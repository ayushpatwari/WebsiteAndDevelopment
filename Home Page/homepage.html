                <h1>Who are we?</h1>

                    technological assistance. 
                </p>
                <h1>Why do we do this?</h1>
                <p>The founders of this company realized that local businesses often had old systems that were 
                    slow, vulnerable, and difficult to deal with. They wanted to change this as this would benefit the business
                    and the customers. 
                </p>
                <h1>What do we do?</h1>
                <p>To provide modern, safe, and easy-to-use systems, ViRtuAl Systems leverages two realms: cloud computing and
                    local compuing. ViRtuAl Systems incorporates cloud services such as AWS and also in person serves to provide
                    the greatest security and ease.

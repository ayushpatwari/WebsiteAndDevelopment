**FBLA Website and Development**

This is our FBLA Website Coding and Development project. These are the sources that we used to create our app:

W3 Schools
CodePen
Blush Design
MagicPattern
Tabler
Bootstrap
Remixicon
WebRTC
Django
AWS
jQuery
Daphne
Django Channels

All of these sources were used under fair use, and were found online through various sources. Our goal with this project is not to profit off of any of these resources, but rather, to showcase our talents in the realm of computer science.

Source code can be seen through the various files in this github.
